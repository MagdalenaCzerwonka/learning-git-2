					Am I out of touch
					Am I out of my place when I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
					Oh I'm wishing you're here but I'm wishing you're gone
					I can't help you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
					Oh Iâ€™m going to mess this up
					Oh this is just my luck
					Over and over and over again
				</p>
				<p>
					Am I out of luck
					Am I waiting to break
					When I keep saying that I'm looking for a way to escape
					Oh I m wishing I had what I'd taken for granted
					I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong

					I'm going to mess this up
					oh this is just my luck
					over and over and over again
				</p>
				<p>
					In the meantime can we let it go
					At the roadside that
					We used to know
					We can let this drift away
					Oh we let this drift away
					At the bayside
					Where you used to show
					In the moonlight
					Where we let it go
					We can let this drift away
					Oh we let this drift away
