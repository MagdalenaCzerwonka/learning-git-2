			<h4>Imagine Dragons</h4>
			<h3>Shots</h3>
			<p>
				Am I out of touch
				Am I out of my place when I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
				Oh I'm wishing you're here but I'm wishing you're gone
				I can't help you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
				Oh Iâ€™m going to mess this up
				Oh this is just my luck
				Over and over and over again
			</p>
			<p>
				Am I out of luck
				Am I waiting to break
				When I keep saying that I'm looking for a way to escape
				Oh I m wishing I had what I'd taken for granted
				I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong

				I'm going to mess this up
				oh this is just my luck
				over and over and over again
